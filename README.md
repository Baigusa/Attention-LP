# Attention-LP
1. CIFAR-10 VGG-16 LP: This file is used for the layer pruning of VGG-16 model on CIFAR-10 dataset using the proposed attention based approaches. Further, it can also be used for the layer pruning of VGG-16 model on CIFAR-100 dataset by doing some minor modifications.
2. ResNet50 FP: This file is used for the filter pruning of ResNet-50 model on CIFAR-10 dataset. Further, it can also be used for the filter pruning of ResNet-50 model on CIFAR-100 dataset by doing some minor modifications.
3. ResNet56 CIFAR: This file is used for the Layer pruning and filter pruning of ResNet-56 model on CIFAR-10 dataset using the proposed attention based approaches. Further, it can also be used for the Layer pruning and filter pruning of ResNet-56 model on CIFAR-100 dataset by doing some minor modifications.
