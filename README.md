# Attention-LP
1. CIFAR-10 VGG-16 LP: This file can be used for the layer pruning of VGG-16 model on CIFAR-10 dataset using our proposed Attention based approach. Further, it can also be used for the CIFAR-100 simulations by doing some minor modifications.
2. ResNet50 FP: This file can be used for the filter pruning of ResNet-50 model on CIFAR-10 dataset. Further, it can also ne used for the CIFAR-100 simulations by doing some minor modifications.
3. ResNet56 CIFAR: This file can be used for the Layer pruning and filter pruning of ResNet-56 model on CIFAR-10 dataset using our proposed Attention based approach. Further, it can also be used for the CIFAR-100 simulations by doing some minor modifications.
4. The raw datasets link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html [47].
 We acessed the datasets from  tensorflow-keras built-in API tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data() and tf.keras.datasets.cifar100.load_data()
